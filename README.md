## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
This example is one of the many learning materials published by Thomson Reuters to help developers learning Thomson Reuters APIs. It contains a C++ example application that demonstrates the concepts explained in the [Sorting/Ranking Level2 Order Books for Display purposes](https://developers.thomsonreuters.com/article/elektron-article-3) article published on the [Thomson Reuters Developer Community portal](https://developers.thomsonreuters.com). 
This example is based on the C++ edition of the Elektron Message API that is one of the APIs of the Thomson Reuters Elektron SDK. Please consult the [Elektron SDK page](https://developers.thomsonreuters.com/elektron/elektron-sdk-cc) for more learning materials and documentation about this API.

**Although the source code is C++ based, the article itself should provide sufficient guidance for a Java developer to implement the sorting mechanism within a Java application.**

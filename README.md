## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
This example is one of the many learning materials published by Refinitiv to help developers learning Refinitiv APIs. It contains a C++ example application that demonstrates the concepts explained in the [Sorting/Ranking Level2 Order Books for Display purposes](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/article-catalog/article/how-sort-process-level-2-orderbook-data-using-ema-c-api) article published on the [Refinitiv Developer Community portal](https://developers.refinitiv.com). 
This example is based on the C++ edition of the Enterprise Message API that is one of the APIs of the Refinitiv Real-time SDK. Please consult the [RT-SDK page](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/api-catalog/refinitiv-real-time-opnsrc/rt-sdk-cc) for more learning materials and documentation about this API.

**Although the source code is C++ based, the article itself should provide sufficient guidance for a Java developer to implement the sorting mechanism within a Java application.**

For any questions related to this article please use the Developer Community [Q&A Forum](https://community.developers.refinitiv.com).
